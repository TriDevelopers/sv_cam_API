## Idea

This project calls multiple API calls to gather necessary information about the given input.

output.json is a JSON representation of the information gathered

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
